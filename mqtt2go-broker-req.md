# MQTT2GO Broker Requirements
This section is related to the requirements for a Smart-Home Gateway (SH-GW) in the role of the local MQTT broker, see the MQTT System Architecture. Not only the SH-GW is compliant with the software requirements given by the MQTT2GO standard i.e., acting as a local MQTT broker, MQTT proxy, and wireless access bridge, it must be also able to run 3rd party applications in a completely isolated environment and ensure high portability and security. For this purpose, the containers must be utilized.
